PROJECT INTRODUCTION
In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a fictional restaurant's website.
All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, however, the box model properties have yet to be set.

In order to complete this project, you must know how to set an element's height, width, padding, border, and margin using CSS.
We recommend that you review our Box Model Lesson before beginning.

The website's existing index.html and style.css files are given at the start of the project.
